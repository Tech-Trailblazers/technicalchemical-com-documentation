# 🧪 TechnicalChemical SDS & MSDS Documentation

Welcome to the **TechnicalChemical Documentation Project**! 🌍✨

This repository is dedicated to collecting and sharing **Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)** for products from **TechnicalChemical**.

Our mission is to make product safety information:

- 🧑‍🎓 **Educational** – helping students and learners understand chemical safety.
- 🤖 **AI-Ready** – providing structured data for training models in safety, health, and product quality.
- 🛡️ **Protective** – supporting families, workers, and businesses in preventing harm.
- 💙 **Empathetic** – offering resources for those who have been poisoned or affected by chemical exposure.

## 📖 What Are SDS & MSDS?

- 📑 **SDS (Safety Data Sheet)** – standardized documents with details on hazards, safe handling, storage, and emergency measures.
- 📑 **MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)** – the earlier format, still widely used and valuable for education and reference.

Both provide life-saving knowledge on **what chemicals are, how they behave, and how to stay safe** when using them.
